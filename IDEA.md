# Idea

I want to create a graph-type visualization of the Emory DSCI faculty members based on their research interests. For each faculty member listed on the department faculty page, create a node.
We'll have weighted edges, with weight based on overlap in research interests. Probably the best way to measure that is papers or authors cited by both or co-authors or the authors who cite their work. Other info that might be relevant is the journals they have published in and arXiv/SSRN field tags. Maybe there are multiple edge types. I don't know. 

The output should be a visualization of the graph, perhaps with nodes colored by research area. Maybe it should be interactive?  The intended audience is students and postdocs who are trying to figure out who they can reach out to for collaborations, advising, etc. This is meant to be pretty as well as useful---we'd like to include it on the department website.
